# AutoEye

**ðŸ”´ The project is currently in its early stages of planning and development and is not yet operational.**

Introducing AutoEye, a cutting-edge open-source solution in development, tailored for streamlined vehicle tracking and management. Whether overseeing a fleet of vehicles or keeping tabs on individual rides for personal purposes, AutoEye will offer live location updates, empowering you to stay on top of things with ease.

## Planned Features
- **Efficient Vehicle Tracking**: AutoEye will seamlessly track vehicles, providing real-time updates on their location and status.
- **Flexible Device Integration**: AutoEye's integration will be customizable and adaptable to your needs. While our software primarily receives vehicles' GPS coordinates through MQTT, packages and scripts for easy integration with various hardware setups are on the roadmap. Stay tuned for upcoming releases, including ROS nodes for reading location coordinates and Python scripts for MQTT communication.

## Getting Started
AutoEye is currently under development, and we're working hard to bring you the best possible experience.
